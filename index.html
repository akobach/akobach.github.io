        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I am typically interested in problems related to quantum field theory. 
            Dynamical systems are becoming increasingly interesting.
            </p>
        <p>Here is <a href="CV.pdf">my CV</a></p>    
        <p>Here is a full <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5aVZ2QAAAAJ&hl=en">list of my publications</a>
            </p>

        Notable results:
        <ol>
            <li>There is a fundamental relationship in the Standard Model of particle physics between the operator's baryon number (B), lepton number (L), and classical mass dimension (d): <strong>(B-L)/2 = d (mod 2)</strong> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05726">hep-ph/1604.05726</a>]. </li>
            <li>The phenomenon of neutrino oscillations in quantum field theory does not require neutrino wave packets, and neutrinos are emitted from the source at differnt times, contrary to popular lore [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07491">hep-ph/1711.07491</a>]. </li>
            <li>The long-standing discrepancy between inclusive and exclusive determinations of <em>V<sub>cb</sub></em>, one of the fundamental parameters in the Standard Model, disappears by removing the assumption of heavy quark effective field theory in the exclusive parameterization [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08170">hep-ph/1703.08170</a>]. </li>
            <li>The correct operator basis for the Lagrangian of a single fermion in an external field was debated for decades, but it can be unambiguously determined using advanced methods in abstract algebra [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00008">hep-ph/1704.00008</a>].</li>
            <li>Constraints of analyticity and unitarity can sufficiently explain the open question why lattice calculations of the semileptonic form factors of <em>B&#8594;D</sup></em> and <em>B<sub>s</sub>&#8594;D<sub>s</sub></em> are similar within a few percent over the entire kinematic range  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13024">hep-ph/1910.13024</a>].</li>

        <a href="https://patents.justia.com/inventor/andrew-c-kobach">Here is a list of my patents</a>  related to preventing vehicular collisions.

        <p></p>
        In March 2025, I won first place in a piano scholarship competition at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music.

        <p></p>
        In Summer 2012, I was one of 75 American delegates chosen by the Department of Energy to attend The Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting dedicated to Physics.  
        During this meeting, the discovery of Higgs was announced.  
        That night I ate dinner seated next to Martinus Veltman, and when I asked him about what he thought of the discovery.  Instead of being excited like everyone else, his response was: "Well...we'll see."
